# Unofficial archive of Scratch projects

Due to the Scratch Team planning to remove access to unshared projects (see [here](https://github.com/LLK/scratch-www/pull/6773)), I had the idea to archive as many old projects as possible with the purpose of preserving Scratch's community history.  An easy-to-use frontend to search projects can be found [here](https://sa.micahlindley.com).

## Progress

Shared Projects on Scratch: `>105,000,000` (From [Scratch Statistics](https://scratch.mit.edu/statistics/))  
Total Projects on Scratch: `~600,000,000`  

Projects Archived So Far: `79,999`  

Progress: `<0.1%`

## Opening project files

All project files are uploaded to The Internet Archive and can be downloaed for free. See [this](#archives) section for the list of archives.

The files all are automatically downloaded with the `.sb3` extension for compatibility, but some older projects may not import correctly.  If Scratch fails to import a project, then attempt to switch the file extension to either `.sb2` or `.sb`.

## Contributing

Not a tech wizard? Use [this](https://github.com/MagentaSuperNova/SB-Auto) tool and skip to step 5.

**1.** Clone this repository to your computer or a cloud machine.  
**2.** Run `npm install`.  
**3.** See what the most recent archived project is, then edit the `START` and `END` varibles in `index.js`.  
**4.** Run `index.js`.  
**5.** Wait until all of the files have downloaded.  
**6.** Put the project files into a folder and compress it as a `.zip`. (Be sure to use `.zip`. Other formats such as `.7izp` & `.tar` don't allow the downloading of individual files.)  
**7.** Go to [The Internet Archive](https://archive.org) and create an account. (If you don't already have one.)  
**8.** Create a new page and upload your `.zip` file.  
**9.** Create an issue like the one below, so we can add it to the [chart](#archives).

Huge thanks to all contributors!
